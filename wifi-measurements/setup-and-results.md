## WiFi setup

Jan and I walked walked through three different buildings: Mensa Hardenbergstraße, Universitätsbibliothek and MAR-Gebäude. We used our tests and tried to cover the most important paths inside the buildings.

* Mensa Hardenbergstraße:
  * We started in the south-western corner near the windows, walked towards the south-eastern corner, went to the stairs in the northern part and upstairs and again at the window front to the south-western corner on the first floor.

* Universitätsbibliothek:
  * We started on ground floor and in "circles" went upstairs through the different levels. From the fourth floor pretty straight-forward back down.

* MAR-Gebäude:
  * For reference we walked the whole foyer from north to south side.

## Reference points

At the moment limited but easily extendable. We simply copied three locations from Google Maps:

* TU Mensa
  * stairs middle platform: 52.509920, 13.325999

* MAR
  * right foyer outmost windows: 52.516986, 13.323999
  * left foyer outmost windows: 52.516170, 13.323326

## Results and conclusion

As you probably see, we could not get any GPS locations inside Mensa and Bibliothek. This seems pretty bad and we don't really know, why. For comparison retrieving GPS locations inside MAR foyer was no problem, although we were able to retrieve three different location pairs at most(!) in the whole foyer. The building and floor information is very helpful and, to our extent, pretty accurate, though.

From my point of view, we can't really rely on somewhat accurate GPS location on this way. The building and floor information can be used very easily.
