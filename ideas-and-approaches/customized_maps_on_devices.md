## Customized Maps on Devices

In order to show indoor positions of other persons on the map a customized map is preferable. These maps might be indoor-maps of certain rooms (Mensa,Library)

The Maps on the Devices must be scalable, interaction with the user should be enabled.

##### Format
Displaying indoor maps on devices might be fullfilled with different approaches:

* **CAD files** can be retrieved by the authorities in order to be used by the app

* **KML file** format can be used to put overlays on devices maps (Google Maps, Apple Maps) Also Map material in CAD-Format can be converted to KML format. The coordinates of the underlying devices Map will be used to show positions mapped on the overlay. (This approach needs precise indoor-coordinates)

* **PDF files** can be also put on top of the device LBS-System. Similarly to KML files those will also use the indoor-coordinates which needs to be mathematically mapped to x/y positons on the pdf in order to show positions on the map.
