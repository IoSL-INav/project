## Notes
* We should (probably) be using the Apache 2 license
** Already added it to our code repositories, leaving out the documentation and project repositories intentionally
* We should contact tubIT MSE API person to get specific information and to discuss how much effort it would take to provide coordinates inside some buildings
* We'll be using Node.JS for backend, Go won't be the first choice
* Therefore we will use
** Node.JS server bootstrap given by Sebastian
** federation provider given by Mathias
* Sebastian has information on how to embrace privacy aware applications from TU
** He will send us the information
* 3 things needed in order to treat privacy right:
** Add a privacy statement
** Follow the concept of "Datensparsamkeit": only retrieve data you absolutely need
** Make every privacy-concerning feature opt-in: nothing is shared/stored/etc. by default, user has to allow everything specifically
* Mathias recommends us to use the IntelliJ IDEA and WebStorm IDEs
