# Team meeting for "IoS Lab - Indoor Navigation"

## Participants
Eridy, Jan, Andreas, Lennart

## Start
19th Oct, 16:15 o'clock

## Subjects

### Current status
* Eridy already got the estimote beacons working
* He'll ask Sebastian to transfer the cloud access to our account
* Some test needs to be done, but overall the accuracy seems to be pretty good
* He'll try to finish the initial setup to show the basic working on friday
* The beacons also include further sensors like temperature and motion sensors
* Idea could be
  * to give everyone one of those estimote beacons
  * to map bigger rooms in about some meters radius areas to get good signal inside the whole room
* Application idea
  * Use a client server architecture with an API to have a user management component on the server side and allow "friends" to access your WiFi/Bluetooth location
* Question:
  * How is dynamic targets meant? Moving people or fixed beacons?
* WiFi measurements
  * We are supposed to be conducting some accuracy measurements of the tubIT WiFi location API
  * Idea is to do these in the Hauptmensa and Universit√§tsbibliothek
* Create use cases and user stories
  * User stories definition: https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories

### Todo until friday
* WiFi measurements
* Initial use cases and user stories
* estimote initial setup
* Literature research
  * Bluetooth Low Energy
  * State of the Art
  * Indoor Navigation

### Requirements
* We'll probably don't need an additional Android device
* Maybe we'll need a virtual machine for our backend part

## Next team meeting
We'll meet on 28th Nov (wednesday) at 10:00 o'clock
